        --part 5 (how the web works)--
    URI (Universal Resourse Identifier) URI is the SUPERSET of URL (Universal Resourse Locator)

        -the Web Browser is a 'Client' and it communicates with a server
        -HTTP is a scheme of protocol that is most common when using API - when we use our browser the browser sends a GET request inorder to retrieve 
                    information from the server -- the GET request will only receive data, does not make any changes
        
        HTTP protocol is the set of rules for Transfering Hyer Text from the server to the 'client'.

        Hyper Text Markup Language is what websites are written in (HTML) and the HTTP is the protocol for transfering that data between server and client.
        
        -HTTP (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol) is a stateless protocol   
        
        
        --part 6 (API constraints)--

                * Client-Server Architecture: a program (browser or app) communicates a request (GET, POST) with a server

                * Statelessness: the server does not remeber anything about the client (that is normally accomplished using 'tokens')

                * Layered System: 

                * Cacheability:

                * Uniform Design:

                * Code on Demand:

            CRUD (Creating, Reading, Updating, and Deleting) the Create method for HTTP is 'POST', the Read would be 'GET', Update method would be 'PUT' & 'PATCH'
                    and the Delete method is 'Delete'

                 explored spotify developers area
                 
       -- part 8 (API from command line using twilio) 
       
       -- part 9 (POSTMAN)

                worked with Postman and set up my Twilio phone to GET sent messages from Twilio # and to POST SMS using Postman to my phone

                set up variables in the Postman program to hold my Twilio Auth, Twilio User, and Twilio Phone #

        -- part 10 (JavaScript Helper Libraries)        

            a lot of helper libraries (or SDK) are available -
